                    <li id="Paragraph"><strong>While using the App: </strong> </li>
                       <ul>
                            <li> Respect all users . We are a culture that is diverse. Therefore, we ask you to respect others' values, interests, and property. Similarly, at any moment, we will not accept racist, misogynistic or disruptive behaviors or actions.</li>
                            <li> Be cautious of long distance relationships and overseas connections. Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country but are stuck elsewhere, especially if they are asking for financial assistance to return home.</li>
                            <li> You know when someones crossed the line and when they do, we want to know about it. Block and notify anyone who breaches our terms. </li>
                            <li>Video Chat Your Date Before Meeting. Its a good idea to get a glimpse of your date before meeting him or her</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li id="Paragraph"><strong>Meeting in Person: </strong> </li>
                       <ul>
                            <li> Do Your Research. Everyone should know the drill- before meeting your date, do a quick Google search. That doesn't mean being a stalker, it just means making sure that you at least have an idea of who the person is before you encounter him or her.</li>
                            <li> Meet in a crowded, public place for the first few occasions, never at your house, the home of your date, or some other private venue. If you are being forced by your date to go to a private place, end the date.</li>
                            <li>Tell your plans, like when and where you're going, to a friend or family member. At all times, have your mobile phone charged and with you. </li>
                            <li>Be specifically aware of the effects of drugs or alcohol on you, which may affect your judgment and your alertness. Keep your ground and end the date if your date wants to push you to use drugs or drink more than you're comfortable with.</li>
                            <li> If you are feeling awkward, it's all right to end the date early. Actually, it's encouraged.</li>

                            <li> All sexual activity must begin with consent and should include your partner's ongoing check-ins. Verbal contact will assist you and your partner to ensure you respect the boundaries of each other. At any moment, consent may be withheld, and sex is never owed to anyone.</li>
